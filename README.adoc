HAProxy with ETCD for REST
====================================

v0.1, October 2015:
Initial version.

Introduction
------------

http://www.haproxy.org/[HAProxy] is a feature rich, easy to configure reverse proxy. + 
https://github.com/coreos/etcd[ETCD] is the distributed hierarchical key/value-store from the CoreOS-project. +
This project provides some shell infrastructure to make HAProxy pull lists of hosts and their associated HTTP-URLs from ETCD.

Purpose
-------

This project is geared towards being used for experimenting with microservices. It gives some ideas on how to do this in production but it's aim is to be usable on a local machine without too much effort.

How it works
------------

Let's say we want to map the following URLs:

/browse +
/detail +
/checkout +

Create a directory for each one in ETCD. Usin cURl you could do the following to create the *checkout*-service and add a host.
-----
curl -L http://<etcdhost>/v2/keys/checkout -XPUT -d dir=true 
curl -L http://<etcdhost>/v2/keys/checkout/<nodename> -XPUT -d value="<host:port>"&ttl=15
-----

- <etcdhost>: Host of your ETCD-instance
- <nodename>: A name for your node for easier debugging
- <host:port>: Host and port under which the URL resides. In this case the service should be reachable as http://<host:port>/checkout

Starting it
-----

Get ETCD installed. Being an Apple user I use http://brew.sh/[Homebrew] for this: +

----
brew install etcd
----

Start watching +

----
etcdctl exec-watch --recursive / -- ./build_cfg_and_reload.sh
----
